## Data Analysis

### Project 1: [Analysis of Music Chords](https://github.com/zachartrand/Audio-Analysis/blob/master/pokemon_audio.ipynb)

This project is an analysis of vocal and instrument chords in the
Area Zero music track of Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet. The beginning
of the track has many sustained chords, including a dissonant
stacked chord, finding the notes of which was the motivation of

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Project 1: [Quaternions](https://github.com/zachartrand/Quaternions)

Module for doing mathematics with quaternions, the 4-dimensional analogue of complex numbers.

```python3
>>> q1, q2 = Quaternion(1, -2, -3, 4), Quaternion(1, 4, -3, -2)
>>> print(q1)
(1 - 2i - 3j + 4k)
>>> print(q2)
(1 + 4i - 3j - 2k)
>>> print(q1+q2)
(2 + 2i - 6j + 2k)
>>> print(q1-q2)
(-6i + 0j + 6k)
>>> print(q2-q1)
(6i + 0j - 6k)
>>> print(q1*q2)
(8 + 20i + 6j + 20k)
>>> print(q2*q1)
(8 - 16i - 18j - 16k)
>>> print(q1/q2)
(-0.19999999999999996 - 0.8i - 0.4j - 0.4k)
>>> print(1/q2 * q1)
(-0.19999999999999996 + 0.4i + 0.4j + 0.8k)
>>> print(q2/q1)
(-0.19999999999999996 + 0.8i + 0.4j + 0.4k)
```

### Project 2: [Chess](https://zachartrand.github.io/Chess/)
